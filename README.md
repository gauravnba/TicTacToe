# TicTacToe
A game of Tic Tac Toe, featuring multiplayer and singleplayer play.
You can select which piece you would like to play with. 'x' always goes first. AI is robust enough to be unbeatable.
The project was made using Visual Studio 2017 and employs the Minimax algorithm to calculate moves for the AI Player.

## Folder structure is as follows:
```
root/--TicTacToe_Sample--build:   Contains the Visual Studio solution file.
                       |
                       |-exec: Contains the executable to run the game.
                       |
                       |-source:  Contains the source files and the project file for Visual Studio.
```
                       
## In the works:
- A graphical user interface using SFML.
- Levels of difficulty for the AI. So that it's easier to win the game, hence, fun.
